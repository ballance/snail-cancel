Motivation
==========
A weekend hackathon to write a service that writes a letter to a service provider to cancel your service.  Low tech solution, but sometimes a letter is the only way to get it done.  Taking an opportunity to write some code with @Hayden.

Summary
=======
It's a pain to cancel a service such as internet, credit card, etc.  There's not always a way to do this online.  Calling the company may take considerable time, if you can even get a human being on the phone.  One way that still seems to work effectively is the snail-mail letter.  The goal of this project is to take some basic user input, write a cancellation letter, and automate as much of the sending process as possible.
